# Sentiment Analysis Pilkada

In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on Jakarta election candidates to predict the winner using Twitter data. The workflow included:

Data collection through crawling with Tweet Harvest.
Manual sentiment labeling (positive/negative).
Data preprocessing such as lemmatization, removing numbers and symbols, tokenization, etc.
Representing features with TF-IDF.
Applying SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms for automatic sentiment prediction.
Extracting insights from frequently occurring words associated with positive or negative sentiments.
Calculating each candidate's winning prospect based on the percentage of positive sentiment and comparing it to the actual results.
This project combined data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enable data-driven decision-making.
